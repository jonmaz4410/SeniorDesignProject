This repository contains all necessary files for my Senior Design Project (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024).

There is another Design Team (Mechanical) and the AXA club collaborating together with us.

AXA handled balloon launch and assisted both Senior Design Teams with their projects when applicable.

Mechanical Team designed a Environmental Control Unit (ECU) with many sensors to monitor CO2, altitude, pressure, etc.
Inside, there are genetically modified plants that are meant to be resilient to space.

Our team's task as the Electrical Team was setting up a communication link using Software-Defined Radio for CubeSat Applications.

Team Members:   Jonathan Mazurkiewicz (me) (team lead)
                Morgan Benavidez
                Carson Van Buren
                David Miloseski
                Zee Fisher
