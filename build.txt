2. Software Requirements / packages / dependencies to install

    Raspberry Pi (64bit ARM architecture)
	- install OS on 32GB SD card using balenaEtcher
		- we used an image from PiSDR here is the link: https://github.com/luigifcruz/pisdr-image
	- dependencies installed for:
		- docker
		- dependencies from mech team (listed in full_go.py) (not part of our project, though we did help a lot)
			- import time
			- import datetime
			- import csv
			- import os
			- import sys
			- import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
			- from PiPocketGeiger import RadiationWatch
			- import ms5837
			- from startUpBMP180 import *
			- from scd30_i2c import SCD30
			- import subprocess
		- manual dependencies inside of folder for their sensors
		- dependencies from Analog website (listed in src)
	- docker image downloaded and built (commands listed in src)
	- mech team sensors plugged in to raspberry pi
	- docker_link folder placed in the home directory
	- rPi configured as an access point
		- this involves altering network config files, follow a guide here: 
			- https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/create-wireless-access-point
		- instead, we used a program called raspap, follow guide here:
			- https://raspap.com/
	- plutoSDR configured with correct IP address and host IP address, follow guide here:
		- https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/customizing
		- the payload has IP address 192.168.3.2 with host IP 192.168.3.11

    Linux Laptop (Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04)
	- installed using USB and balenaEtcher
	- PlutoSDR drivers here: https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/drivers/linux
	- configure IP address and host IP address for plutoSDR
		- the groundstation has IP address 192.168.3.1 with host IP 192.168.3.10
	- install Gnu Radio 3.8.5.0 (commands listed in src)
	- flask files, gnu radio receiver files, and parser files all downloaded from this repository into one directory (preferred)
